Here I present to you a typical work task I handle as a part time HR Data Analyst (the other part is me being just a regular Talent Acqusition Specialist ðŸ˜‰) 
- as a Talent Acquisition team we needed to answer a question whether or not we need to keep posting our job ads on Polish job boards. I was tasked with taking a look at other
companies on the market. To prepare this project I used **Excel and Power Bi**.

The data was acquired with the best care possible, but not all of it was easily available for just the Polish sector or very current, so some numbers are best estimates. 
This sample contains 54 companies separated into four typesbased on size of the company: small (<250 employees), medium (250-1000), big (1000-5000) and huge (5000+). Uploading
Excel and Power Bi files is not possible, so I'm uploading screenshots of them.
